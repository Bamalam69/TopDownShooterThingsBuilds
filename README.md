# TopDownShooterThingsBuilds

Welcome!
This GitHub Project is dedicated for holding all the Public Builds for Project_TopDownShooterThing! If you'd like to download a build, just crack open one of the .zips and hit the download button on the top right. From there you can either extract it to somewhere or just straight run it from the .zip folder!
Right now global multiplayer hasn't been implemented. But you can still test it by opening the game twice. From there you can click Host Game on one client, then join it from the other client.

Have fun!
